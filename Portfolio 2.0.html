            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Jayla, and I am an Alumni of Middle Tennessee State University. My time at this university taught me many lessons on leadership, team-work, and community engagement. Those lessons have made me into the hardworking person I am today.</p>
            <p>I have been a part of many committees and organizations that deal with Professional Selling, Marketing, and Public Relations. I am someone who loves to be involved in any organization they are in. I joined a lot of clubs in high school and attended almost every event. I still do that in college. I am extrovert, and I am on a mission to encourage to everyone I meet.</p>
